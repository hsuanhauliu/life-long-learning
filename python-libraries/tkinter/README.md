# Tkinter
[Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) is Python's built-in GUI package. This directory contains the most basic examples of Tkinter to showcase its capability. They also serve as notes for future reference.

The examples below are drawn from thenewboston's tutorial series: [Python GUI with Tkinter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJB1Ek2Ko_Y&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBwibXFtPtflztSNPGuIB_d). All credits go to him.
