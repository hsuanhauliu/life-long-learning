# React
Notes taken from this amazing tutorial video made by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A).

## Create New Project
Install npm (node package manager) locally.
```
brew install node
```

### Optional
Install React developer tools from Chrome Store for easier development.

## Start A New Project
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
This will quickly set up a React project folder called my-app and run a local server. This is the preferred way to start a project.
