## Challenges
### [Overfitting and Underfitting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/underfitting-and-overfitting-in-machine-learning/)

Overfitting Solutions:
- Regularization
- Data augmentation
- Dropout layer
- Early stopping
- Batch normalization
- Activation functions
- Optimizer

Underfitting Solution:
- Use a more complicated, bigger model
