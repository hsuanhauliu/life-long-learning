# Facial Alignment Notebook
_"Face alignment is a computer vision technology for identifying the geometric structure of human faces in digital images. Given the location and size of a face, it automatically determines the shape of the face components such as eyes and nose."_ - [Springer](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-73003-5_186)
